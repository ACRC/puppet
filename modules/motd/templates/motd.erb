In order to protect the security and working of University network and
computer systems, it may be necessary to monitor or log the use of these
systems. If there are indications of abuse of systems, or that individuals
may be using systems in excess of their authority, files, messages and
any or all uses of the systems may be intercepted, monitored, recorded,
copied, audited, inspected and disclosed to authorised University and
law enforcement personnel.
